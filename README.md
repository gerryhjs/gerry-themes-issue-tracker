If you have any problem about Gerry Themes or Gerry Themes Pro, please commit issue here. Thanks.

# Please read it before you submit issue:

* About New UI 

Gerry Themes and Gerry Themes Pro plan to support the new UI, but for IDEA 2022.3 EAP the new UI is not stable, if you have problems with plugins using the new UI, please change the theme to Jetbrains Darcula to double check if it is a plugin issue.

* About color schema

Gerry Themes and Gerry Themes Pro use contrasting colors for better syntax highlighting, but the color mode may not work for everyone. If you have any suggestions for colors, please feel free to submit an issue and I will consider everyone's ideas if it makes sense.

Some color displays were modified as features, not bugs, such as buttons being changed to outlines with a hollow in the middle. However it is welcome to submit an issue for discussion if you think something is best unmodified.

* About suggestion idea

Once a good suggestion for themes is adopted I will give the issue reporter a special discount code as grateful.
